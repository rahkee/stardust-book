                <h1>The Back Story</h1>

                <div class="hr">
                    <img src="images/hr-bar-small.png" alt="" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    On a beautiful spring day in Arizona, a journaling session
                    led me to acknowledge the lessons that were gifted to me
                    from my greatest challenges. In that moment of clarity, a
                    little whisper nudged me to write a poem, which became
                    “Stardust.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Stardust” showed up as a reflection of my own life. It was
                    a call to action, urging me to start sharing the music deep
                    inside me. I had poems that were sitting dormant in my
                    journal for years, and I began sharing my work online and at
                    open mics, leading to speaking invitations from conferences
                    around the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The feedback resonated with a shared desire: "We want these
                    poems for our children."
                </p>

                <p>
                    One morning, I awoke from a dream visualizing “Stardust” as
                    a children's book. Eagerly, I noted every detail. Weeks
                    before this, I'd met Daniel Fleck, an incredibly creative
                    artist. Seeing this as serendipitous, I approached him about
                    collaborating, and after seeing his initial sketches and
                    beautiful interpretation of Stardust, we KNEW that we had to
                    create SOMETHING together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With my niece Yara's birth, dear friends having children,
                    and my niece and nephew moving close, I was inspired to
                    create something special for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Daniel shared that in lieu of having children of his own
                    yet, he aspired to share the love that would occupy that
                    space with the world; an act of service that could benefit
                    current and future generations. This project aligned
                    perfectly. It felt divinely appointed, as if we were
                    selected to be honored conduits of these messages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We committed to monthly catch-ups, sharing life updates and
                    book progress. After a year, our labor of love, "Stardust",
                    is now ready to make its debut. Trust, authenticity, and a
                    shared vision fueled our journey, and we hope it instills
                    the same values in those who experience "Stardust.”
